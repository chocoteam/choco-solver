## Configuration parameters

# Set to true to plug explanation engine in
PLUG_EXPLANATION = true

# Set to true print explanations
PRINT_EXPLANATION = false

# Set to true to add propagators to explanation
PROP_IN_EXP = false

# Set to true to print propagation information
PRINT_PROPAGATION = false

# Set to true to print event occurring on disjunctions
PRINT_VAR_EVENT = false

# Set to true to print scheduling information
PRINT_SCHEDULE = false

##
# Define what answer should be given when a variable occurs more than once in a propagator
# disabled : throw an error when a variable occurs more than once
# silent : do not do anything
# warn : print a warning message when a variable occurs more than once
# view: detect each occurrence, replace additional occurrences with an EQ view
# duplicate: detect each occurrence, duplicate the variable and post and EQ constraint
MUL_OCC_VAR_PROP = silent

##
# Define how to react when a propagator is not ensured to be idempotent
# /!\ only works with PropagatorEngine /!\
# disabled : does not anything
# error: print an error message when a propagator is not guaranteed to be idempotent -- fir debug only
# force : extra call to Propagator.propagate(FULL_PROPAGATION) when no more event is available
IDEMPOTENCY = disabled

# Defines the rounding precision for multicostregular algorithm
# MUST BE < 13 as java messes up the precisions starting from 10E-12 (34.0*0.05 == 1.70000000000005)
MCR_PRECISION = 4
