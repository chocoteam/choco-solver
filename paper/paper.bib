  abstract = {In an increasing number of domains such as bioinformatics, combinatorial graph problems arise. We propose a novel way to solve these problems, mainly those that can be translated to constrained subgraph finding. Our approach extends constraint programming by introducing CP(Graph), a new computation domain focused on graphs including a new type of variable: graph domain variables as well as constraints over these variables and their propagators. These constraints are subdivided into kernel constraints and additional constraints formulated as networks of kernel constraints. For some of these constraints a dedicated global constraint and its associated propagator are sketched. CP(Graph) is integrated with finite domain and finite sets computation domains, allowing the combining of constraints of these domains with graph constraints.A prototype of CP(Graph) built over finite domains and finite sets in Oz is presented. And we show that a problem of biochemical network analysis can be very simply described and solved within CP(Graph).},

This paper proposes activity-based search which uses the activity of variables during propagation to guide the search. Activity-based search was compared experimentally to impact-based search and the wdeg heuristics but not to solution counting heuristics. Experimental results on a variety of benchmarks show that activity-based search is more robust than other heuristics and may produce significant improvements in performance.",

abstract="A key feature of constraint programming is the ability to design specific search strategies to solve problems. On the contrary, integer programming solvers have used efficient general-purpose strategies since their earliest implementations. We present a new general purpose search strategy for constraint programming inspired from integer programming techniques and based on the concept of the impact of a variable. The impact measures the importance of a variable for the reduction of the search space. Impacts are learned from the observation of domain reduction during search and we show how restarting search can dramatically improve performance. Using impacts for solving multiknapsack, magic square, and Latin square completion problems shows that this new criteria for choosing variables and values can outperform classical general-purpose strategies.",

abstract="Scheduling urban and trans-urban transportation is an important issue for industrial societies. The Urban Transit Crew Scheduling Problem is one of the most important optimization problem related to this issue. It mainly relies on scheduling bus drivers' workday respecting both collective agreements and the bus schedule needs. If this problem has been intensively studied from a tactical point of view, its operational aspect has been neglected while the problem becomes more and more complex and more and more prone to disruptions. In this way, this paper presents how the constraint programming technologies are able to recover the tactical plans at the operational level in order to efficiently help in answering regulation needs after disruptions.",

abstract="The cumulative constraint is the key to the success of Constraint Programming in solving scheduling problems with cumulative resources. It limits the maximum amount of a resource consumed by the tasks at any time point. However, there are few global constraints that ensure that a minimum amount of a resource is consumed at any time point. We introduce such a constraint, the MinCumulative. We show that filtering the constraint is NP-Hard and propose a checker and a filtering algorithm based on the fully elastic relaxation used for the cumulative constraint. We also show how to model MinCumulative using the SoftCumulative constraint. We present experiments comparing the different methods to solve MinCumulative using Constraint Programming.",
