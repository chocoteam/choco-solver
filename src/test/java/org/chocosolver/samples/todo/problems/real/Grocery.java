 * "A kid goes into a grocery store and buys four items. The cashier
 * charges $7.11, the kid pays and is about to leave when the cashier
 * calls the kid back, and says ''Hold on, I multiplied the four items
 * instead of adding them; I'll try again; Hah, with adding them the
 * price still comes to $7.11''. What were the prices of the four items?
 * <p/>
 * The model is taken from: Christian Schulte, Gert Smolka, Finite Domain
 * Constraint Programming in Oz. A Tutorial. 2001."
 * <br/>
 * <p/>
 * This problem deals with large domains which result in integer overflows with classical constraints.
 * Thus, this example introduces a dedicated propagator which handles large value products.
