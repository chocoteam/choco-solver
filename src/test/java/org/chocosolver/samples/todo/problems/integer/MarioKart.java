 * <h3>Path Constraint Problem</h3>
 *
 * <h2>The Problem</h2> The path problem a simple problem where we are trying to find the best path in a directed graph.
 * A path is a succession of node starting from the source node to the destination node. Each node has to be connected
 * to the previous and the next node by a a directed edge in the graph. The path can't admit any cycle </br>
 *
 * <h2>The Model</h2> This model will specify all the constraints to make a coherent path in the graph. The graph is both
 * represented by a BoolVar matrix and an array of IntVar (successor representation). For instance, if the boolean (i, j)
 * of the matrix is equals to true, that means that the path contains this edge starting from the node of id i to the node
 * of id j. If the edge doesn't exists in the graph the the boolean value is equals to the Choco constants FALSE.
 * Else the edge can be used or not, so its representation is a choco boolean variable which can be instantiated to
 * true : edge is in the path or to false : the edge isn't in the path.
 *
 * <h2>The Example</h2> We are presenting this problem through an little example of Mario's day. </br> Mario is an
 * Italian Plumber and is work is mainly to find gold in the plumbing of all the houses of the neighborhood. Mario is
 * moving in the city using his kart that has a specified amount of fuel. Mario starts his day of work from his personal
 * house and always end to his friend Luigi's house to have the supper. The problem here is to plan the best path for
 * Mario in order to earn the more money with the amount of fuel of his kart ! </p> (Version 1.3) We are making the
 * analogy of this problem to the knapsack problem. In fact we want to found a set of edges that form a path where Mario
 * can find the more gold and respects the fuel limit constraint. The analogy is the following :
 * <ul>
 * <li>The weight is the consumption to go through the edge</li>
 * <li>The energy is the gold that we can earn on the house at the end of the edge</li>
 * </ul>
