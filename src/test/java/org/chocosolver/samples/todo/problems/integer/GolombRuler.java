 * A Golomb ruler may be defined as a set of m integers 0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_m such that
 * the m(m-1)/2 differences a_j - a_i, 1 <= i < j <= m are distinct.
 * Such a ruler is said to contain m marks and is of length a_m.

 * The objective is to find optimal (minimum length) or near optimal rulers.
