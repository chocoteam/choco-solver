 * This interface describes services of smallest element which can act on variables.
 * As an example, propagator is a cause because it filters values from variable domain.

 * It has an impact on domain variables and so it can fails.

 *     needs to evaluate the incoming event, one may be aware that in some cases (for instance, BoolVar), the original event can promoted.
 *     Hence, if a cause can only explain bound modifications, it should also either consider the INSTANTIATION or the strengthen mask.
