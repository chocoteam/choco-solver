/**
 * A monitor for Variable, to observe variable modification (for integer variable : value removals, bounds modification
 * or instantiation) and do something right after the modification.
 * <p/>
 * This differs from {@link org.chocosolver.solver.constraints.Propagator} because it is not scheduled in the propagation engine.
 * However, it assumes that <code>this</code> executes fast and low complexity operations.
 * Otherwise, it should be a propagator.
 * <p/>
 * This also differs from {@link org.chocosolver.solver.variables.view.IView} because it is not a specific variable, and can connect
 * two or more variables together. For instance, this can be used for logging issue.
