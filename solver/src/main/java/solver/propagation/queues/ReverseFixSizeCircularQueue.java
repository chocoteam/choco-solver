/**
 * A fix sized circular queue optimized for removing first and last elements.
 * Some few (essential regarding the usage) methods are implemented.
 * <br/>
 * Be aware of the size computation: the modulo operation is not efficient in java.
 * On the other hand, the modulo of powers of 2 can alternatively be expressed as a bitwise AND operation:
 * <br/>
 * x % 2n == x & (2n - 1)
 * <br/>
 * That is why the size of the data is automatically set to the closest greater powers of 2 value.
