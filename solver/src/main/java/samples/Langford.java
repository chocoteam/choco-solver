/**
 * CSPLib prob024:<br/>
 * "Consider two sets of the numbers from 1 to 4.
 * The problem is to arrange the eight numbers in the two sets into a single sequence in which
 * the two 1's appear one number apart,
 * the two 2's appear two numbers apart,
 * the two 3's appear three numbers apart,
 * and the two 4's appear four numbers apart.
 * <p/>
 * The problem generalizes to the L(k,n) problem,
 * which is to arrange k sets of numbers 1 to n,
 * so that each appearance of the number m is m numbers on from the last.
 * <br/>
 * For example, the L(3,9) problem is to arrange 3 sets of the numbers 1 to 9 so that
 * the first two 1's and the second two 1's appear one number apart,
 * the first two 2's and the second two 2's appear two numbers apart, etc."
