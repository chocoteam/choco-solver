/**
 * A Graph Variable is defined by a domain which is a graph interval [LB, UB].
 * An instantiation of a graph variable is a graph composed of nodes and edges (directed or not).
 * LB is the kernel graph (or lower bound), that must be a subgraph of any instantiation.
 * UB is the envelope graph (or upper bound), such that any instantiation is a subgraph of it.
 *
 * --- GRAPH API REFACTORING 04/03/2021 ---
 *
 * In accordance with IGraph:
 *
 * - The semantic distinction between arcs and edges has been removed for more clarity. If the graph is undirected,
 *      edges are undirected, if the graph is directed, the graph is directed. Methods related to edges are
 *      `enforceEdge` and `removeEdge`.
 *
 * - The object model is such that the more abstract interface specifies directed graph variable accessors on edges,
 *      `getMandatorySuccessorsOf`, `getPotentialSuccessorsOf`, `getMandatoryPredecessorsOf`, and
 *      `getPotentialPredecessorsOf`. When the graph is undirected, the methods `getMandatoryNeighborsOf` and
 *      `getPotentialNeighborsOf` are available. Note that an undirected graph is equivalent to a directed graph
 *      with couples of opposite directed edges. Thus, the neighbors of a node in an undirected graph are both
 *      successors and predecessors, and this is why these methods are equivalent to `getMandatoryNeighbors` and
 *      `getPotentialNeighborssOf` in the case of an undirected graph. To encourage unambiguous use and facilitate
 *      code reading, the successors and predecessors related method have been defined as deprecated in explicit uses
 *      of UndirectedGraphs.
 *
 *  - The possibility to chose (in constructors) and get the set data structure for nodes has also been added,
 *      as it was only implemented for neighbors: `getNodeSetType` and `getEdgeSetType`. The previous default behaviour
 *      has been conserved with default constructors.
