## Choco3 ##

The current release is a beta version.

Choco3 comes with:
- various type of variables (integer, boolean, set, graph and real),
- various state-of-the-art constraints (alldifferent, count, nvalues, etc.),
- various search strategies, from basic ones (first_fail, smallest, etc.) to most complex (impact-based and activity-based search),
- explanation-based engine, that enables conflict-based back jumping, dynamic backtracking and path repair,

But also, a FlatZinc parser, facilities to interact with the search loop, factories to help modelling, many samples, etc.

## Usage ##
### Inside a maven project ###

The maven artifact is available through a private repository
so you have first to edit your `pom.xml` to declare it:

```xml
<repositories>
    <repository>
        <id>choco.repos</id>
        <url>http://www.emn.fr/z-info/choco-repo/mvn/repository/</url>
    </repository>
</repositories>
```

Next, just declare the dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
   <groupId>choco</groupId>
   <artifactId>choco-solver</artifactId>
   <version>13.04-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

### Inside a non-maven project ###

The jar can be downloaded from this URL:

* http://www.emn.fr/z-info/choco-repo/mvn/repository/choco/choco-solver/13.04-SNAPSHOT/choco-solver-13.04-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

The file contains `choco-environment`, `choco-solver`artifacts and their dependencies.

## Building from sources ##

Requirements:
* JDK 7+
* maven 3+

The source of the released versions are directly available in the `Tag` section.
You can also download them using github features.
Once downloaded, move to the source directory then execute the following command
to make the jar:

    $ mvn clean install -DskipTests

If the build succeeded, the resulting jar will be automatically
installed in your local maven repository and available in the `target` sub-folders.
