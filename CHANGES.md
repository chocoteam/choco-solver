3.2.2 - 17 Nov 2014
-------------------

- Fix #240: add notmember(IntVar, SetVar) constraint (more efficient than not(member))
- Fix #225: fix PropCostRegular, wrt to S.Demassey instructions.

            + add external configuration of the search strategy through a binder
- Fix #227: deal with initial propagation
