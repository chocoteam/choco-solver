- Add `AbstractStrategy.remove()` method to remove a declared strategy and its dependencies
- Add new strategies to `Search`
- Add new decomposition to `IDecompositionFactory`

- `INeighborFactory#explanationBased(IntVar...)` is deprecated, no replacement.
- `ILearnFactory#setCBJLearning(boolean,boolean)` and `ILearnFactory#setDBTLearning(boolean,boolean)` are deprecated, see `ILearnFactory#setLearningSignedClauses()` instead

\#604, #605, #606

4.0.9 - 30 Oct 2018
-------------------

4.0.8 - 23 Jul 2018
-------------------

Update DefaultSettings with right version

4.0.7 - 19 Jul 2018
-------------------

**JAR file names have changed**:  
- the suffix 'with-dependencies' disappears,
- the suffix '-no-dep' (for no dependencies) appears.

This should intends to clarify the selection for new comers.

Add a PayPal button for donations.

Move to Ibex-2.6.5.

### Major features:

- Revamp `Settings`: no default method anymore, add setters. A concrete class `DefaultSettings` provides
the default behavior.
- `IViewFactory.intScaleView` now manages negative constants,
- `IViewFactory.intAffineView` is now available
- add new constraint for mixed linear equation (over real/int variables and double/int coefficients)
- Dow/WDeg now manages variables in a bipartite set (instantiated variables are swaped)
- Assert that a propagator that is passive is not allowed to filter anymore
- An exception is thrown when a sum (or scalar) constraint is candidate for integer over/underflow (an alternative should be provided later)
- `BoolVar` now handles modifications in different way (may impact performances)
- Propagation engine has changed: no alternative to seven-queue one anymore + simplification of code (may impact performances)
- add new relation expression `ift(e1,e2)`

### Deprecated API (to be removed in next release):
-  `Model.set(Settings)` is deprecated. Now settings are declared in the `Model` constructor.
- `Settings.debugPropagation()` is deprecated. There is no alternative.

\#527, #564, #569, #576, #578, #581, #586

4.0.6 - 23 Nov 2017
-------------------

Move to Ibex-2.6.3.

### Major features:
- Ibex instance is no longer static, that offers better stability and reduce
memory consumption when adding/removing functions. Reification no longer managed by Choco but 
delegated to Ibex. 
- `Search.realVarSearch(...)` offers possibility to define minimal range size, known as `epsilon`
- `Search.ibexSolving(model)` let Ibex iterates over solutions **once all integer variables are instantiated**
- add detection of min/max sub-cases
- add simple dashboard in Swing to show resolution statistics, see `solver.showDashboard()`

### Deprecated API (to be removed in next release):
- `IntEqRealConstraint` will be removed in next release, Ibex managed this concept (int to real)
- `Model.getIbex()` should not be used. A `IbexHandler` manages Ibex instances (one per model).
