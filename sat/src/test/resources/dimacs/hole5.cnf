c The SAT encoding of this problem is very straightforward.  For each pigeon i
c and each hole j we have a variable x_{n*(i-1)+j} which means that pigeon i
c is placed in hole j.  Then we have n+1 clauses which say that a pigeon has
c to be placed in some hole.  Then for each hole we have a set of clauses
c ensuring that only one single pigeon is placed into that hole.
c
c This encoding leads to a total of (n+1) * n propositional variables and
c (n+1) + n * (n * (n+1) / 2) clauses.
c
c The resulting SAT problem is unsatisfiable.
